# InteractiveDashboard - PowerBI
This is an Interactive Dashboard that displays some statistics related to the Israeli-Palestinian war since the year 2000 until the beginning of 2023 (based on the Dataset). The Dataset used for the dashboard was taken from Kaggle.

Summary of the Dataset:
The dataset contains information about individuals who have passed away, including their names, the dates and locations of their martyrdom, their nationality and gender, as well as details on the circumstances of their death, such as the method (e.g., firing, shelling) and the responsible party (e.g., Israeli security forces, Palestinian civilians).

Important Takeaways:
1. More Men were killed than Women.
2. Israeli Security Forces are the major cause of deaths throughout these years.
3. Majority of the people killed bear Palestinian Citizenship.
4. Majority of the killings happened due to gun firing.

It is important to note that the number of Palestinian martyrs has doubled since the dataset was published. If this indicates anything, it indicates the real terrorists (the Israeli occupation army) who are committing massacres against innocent people in full view of everyone.
